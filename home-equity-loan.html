            <p>Get a second home loan with your home equity</p>
            <b>What Is A Home Equity Loan?</b>
            <p>A home equity loan allows you to borrow against the equity you have in your home to invest in shares or property, repay your debts, renovate or pay for lifestyle expenses.</p>
            <p>Until recently, house prices have risen rapidly across most of Australia, giving homeowners a readily available and inexpensive source of credit. Using your home equity to expand your investment portfolio could be one of the best ways to earn passive income in Australia right now.</p>

            <b>Our popular articles on home equity loans</b> <br>
            <b>For borrowers</b>
            <p>No deposit loans have become an attractive option for many people who do not have the funds to contribute towards a mortgage. Some of the main benefits of using a guarantor to get a no deposit home loans include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>No savings are needed.</li>
              <li>You can borrow the full purchase amount plus the money needed for stamp duty or any other associated costs.</li>
              <li>Lenders mortgage insurance (LMI) is not required, saving you thousands!</li>
              <li>Both investors and home buyers can take advantage of this loan.</li>
              <li>In many cases the interest rates are exceptionally low.</li>
            </ul>




            <b>For guarantors</b>
            <p>Guarantors have a fixed liability and can only be pursued for the guaranteed amount, making this a more secure option. The guarantee can be secured by either their property or a term deposit.</p>
            <p>Guarantors do not have to make the scheduled loan repayments and the guarantee can be released upon request if, at a later date, the borrower meets standard bank criteria and the bank agrees. Normally, this is when the borrower owes less than 80% of the value of their property.</p>



            <b>What if these options don’t work for me?</b>
            <p>Unfortunately, the options listed above are the only ones under which lenders in Australia offer no deposit house loans</p>
            <p>The best way for you to get a home loan is to save a deposit of your own.</p>
            <p>Following these tips will help you qualify:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Prepare to buy: Use our prepare to buy program to prepare to qualify for a mortgage.</li>
              <li>Save a 5%-10% deposit: Save 5%+ of the purchase price in a bank account in your name. Make regular contributions.</li>
              <li>Don’t change jobs: When you are borrowing close to 100% of the purchase price, lenders like to see that you are stable and that you have been in your job for some time.</li>
              <li>Pay your bills on time: If you don’t have much of a deposit then lenders will lose a significant amount of money if you can’t make the repayments. For this reason, they look very closely at your credit file and rental history.</li>
            </ul>


            <p>Is rent as genuine savings accepted as a no deposit option?</p>
            <p>No, lenders will not consider rent as genuine savings for a no deposit home loan.</p>
            <p>Rent is used as genuine savings so the lender can determine if the borrower can commit to a home loan.</p>
            <p>Genuine savings must be accumulated over three months. So, when you’re borrowing over 85% of the property value, lenders will check your character to make sure you can make repayments without hardships.</p>



            <b>How to get approved for a home loan without a deposit</b>
            <br>
            <b>What are the lending criteria for no deposit loan?</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Here’s what lenders look at when assessing your no deposit home loan application:</li>
              <li>Credit history: You must have a perfect credit history with Equifax. No Australian lenders will make an exception to this policy if LMI approval is required.</li>
              <li>Repayment history: You must be paying all of your current debts such as credit cards, personal loans and rent on time.</li>
              <li>Location restrictions: You must be buying in a major town, capital city or regional centre. One of our lenders is willing to consider anywhere in Australia but most lenders are very strict about the location.</li>
              <li>Property type: You must be buying a standard type of property such as a house, townhouse, unit or vacant land. As a general rule, unusual or unique properties are not acceptable.</li>
              <li>Stable employment: Your employment situation must be stable and ongoing.</li>
              <li>Income: Your income must be high enough that you can easily service the loan. You cannot borrow to your limit with a high Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) mortgage.</li>
              <li>Profession: Professionals such as accountants, lawyers, doctors, vets, nurses, government employees and teachers are highly sought after by lenders because they are well known to be a lower risk than people in other professions. You don’t need to be a professional to get approved but it helps!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Are no deposit loans available Australia-wide?</p>
            <p>No deposit home loans are available in capital cities and major regional centres:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Sydney (Wollongong, Queanbeyan, Newcastle, Wagga Wagga, Tamworth, Coffs Harbour, Albury, Wodonga)</li>
              <li>Melbourne (Ballarat, Bendigo)</li>
              <li>Brisbane (Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Cairns, Toowoomba, Townsville, Ipswitch, Bundaberg)</li>
              <li>Adelaide</li>
              <li>Perth (Freemantle, Geraldton)</li>
              <li>Darwin</li>
              <li>Canberra</li>
            </ul>


            <b>What if you are outside these areas?</b>
            <p>One of our lenders will accept no deposit loans with the help of a guarantor in any location in Australia!</p> 
            <p>As an online mortgage broker, we can help you secure a no deposit house loan across Australia. Call us on 1800 771 900 or enquire online today.</p>
            <p>Can I borrow 100% and consolidate my debts?</p>
            <p>Yes, you can borrow 100% and consolidate your other debts such as HECS/HELP, personal loans and credit cards provided you have a guarantor who is working and allows you to use their property as additional security for your loan.</p>
            <p>There are no lenders in Australia that can lend more than 100% of the purchase price with a no deposit loan that is not supported by a guarantee.</p>
            <p>We can compare the options from our panel of lenders for you. With help from our experts you’ll get approved for the amount you need at a competitive interest rate.</p>
            <p>Who can borrow 100%?</p>
            <p>Buying a house to live in: First home buyers and other people buying an owner-occupied house make up the majority of people applying for 100% home loans in Australia, with the help of a guarantor.</p>
            <p>They are looked at favourably by the banks because they tend to look after their property well and are more likely to pay their loan on time. Comparatively speaking, they are lower risk borrowers.</p>


            <p><b>Investors:</b> Investors are eligible for no deposit finance if they have a guarantor but they may be required to meet more stringent criteria due to the higher risk their application poses to the banks.</p>
            <p>In some cases this requirement can be waived; for example, for someone who lives with their parents and wants to buy an investment property as their first property rather than a place to live in.</p>
            <p>Investors who reduce their loan amount to 95% of the property value have a wider choice of lenders.</p>



            <b>FAQs</b> <br>
            <b>Is it better to save a deposit or borrow with no deposit?</b>
            <p>That depends on the property market.</p>
            <p>If you are in a market that is increasing in value, more often than not it is far cheaper to borrow 100% using a guarantor or borrow 95% and pay LMI, than to wait and save a deposit. This is because the lost capital gains from waiting to buy and paying more ends up costing you tens of thousands of dollars.</p>
            <p>Most people find it difficult to save a deposit anyway and, after six months, are in the same situation they were in before. For this reason, most people prefer to borrow 100% rather than to save.</p>
            <p>You can use our calculator to decide if you should buy now or save a larger deposit.</p>
            <p>Don’t forget that Australia is not a single property market! For example, Brisbane may be increasing in value while Sydney and Melbourne remain steady. Talk to local real-estate agents to find out what is happening near you.</p>
            <p>If you are in an area that is stable or declining in value, then it may be better to save a 5%-10% deposit and apply for a 95% loan if you would prefer not to use a guarantor. You can even use inheritance as a deposit for this.</p>
            <p>Please contact us on 1800 771 900 or enquire online and we can discuss your options with you so you can make an informed decision as to when to apply for a loan.</p>



            <p>1. Do home loans without a deposit have extra features?</p>

            <p>Yes! No deposit home loans with a guarantor are available with almost all loan features including:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Professional package discounts</li>
              <li>Waived application, valuation and monthly fees</li>
              <li>Fixed rates (1 year, 3 years, 5 years, 10 years and 15 years)</li>
              <li>100% offset accounts</li>
              <li>Unlimited extra repayments (variable rate loans only)</li>
              <li>Redraw facilities</li>
              <li>Interest only repayments (up to 15 years)</li>
              <li>Weekly, fortnightly or monthly repayments</li>
              <li>Vacant land, building or construction loans</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note that no deposit finance is not available with a line of credit loan. You have the option to switch loan types at a later date when the guarantee has been removed.</p>
            <p>Before you undertake a comparison of different no deposit loans you should complete a needs analysis with a mortgage broker. You should consider which features will give you the biggest benefit and which you are likely to use.</p>


            <b>How high will my interest rate be?</b>
            <p>Not as high as you think! No deposit home loans with a guarantor are often available at competitive interest rates and even application fee waivers for some loans.</p>
            <p>We are able to obtain professional packages and basic loan discounts through several of our lenders.</p>
            <p>Did you know that some lenders have very little appetite for high-LVR home loans? A high-LVR loan is any loan that is for more than 80% of the property value.</p>
            <p>The secret to getting a good interest rate is to apply with a bank that is actively seeking this market segment. As mortgage brokers we know which lenders are aggressively marketing to 95% and 100% borrowers. </p>
            <p>Please contact us on 1800 771 900 or enquire online to find out how we can help you.</p>



            <b>How can I get a low interest rate?</b>
            <p>Sometimes it seems like every bank and non-bank lender in Australia has very similar interest rates and fees. However, for 100% home loans, some banks are way ahead of the pack, with interest rates unmatched by their competitors. This is because some banks are interested in lending over 90% of the property value, whereas others aren’t.</p>

            <p>Our brokers are also likely able to negotiate an interest rate lower than that advertised by the banks!</p>


            <b>How much LMI will I pay?</b>
            <p>Going for a guarantor loan will save you a small fortune, as you will not pay an LMI premium. If you can’t get a guarantor loan, you’ll probably have to pay LMI.</p>
            <p>LMI rates vary depending on the lender you choose and the amount you borrow.As a general rule, LMI for loans that are less than $300,000 are very cheap while LMI for loans over $500,000 can become quite expensive, at roughly 4% of the loan amount.</p>
            <p>You can use our mortgage insurance calculator to estimate the cost of LMI.</p>
            <p>When you are required to pay LMI, you only receive 92%-94% of the property value to put towards the purchase if you are applying for a 95% loan. That’s in spite of the fact that you applied for a larger percentage of the purchase price!</p>
            <p>Some lenders allow you to capitalise the LMI premium on top of the loan up to 97%, or even 100% of the purchase price. This allows you to use the 95% for which you applied towards paying for the house!</p>
            <p>You also have the option to pay monthly LMI with one of our lenders.</p>
            <p>Please call us on 1800 771 900 or enquire online for an LMI interest rate quote specific to your situation.</p>


            <b>Which lenders have no deposit loans?</b>
            <p>A wide variety of bank and non-bank lenders offer no deposit finance with the help of a guarantor.</p>
            <p>These lenders include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ANZ</li>
              <li>Bank West</li>
              <li>CBA</li>
              <li>CBA</li>
              <li>St. George Bank</li>
              <li>Suncorp</li>
              <li>Westpac</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Our panel of lenders tend to offer special discounts from time to time so the “best” no deposit lender changes each month.</p>

            <b>Are there any drawbacks to no deposit home loans?</b>
            <p>You should consider whether a no deposit solution is really in your best interests.</p>
            <p>This is particularly true if you already have the savings you need or you’re in a good financial position and can save a deposit in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
            <p>Although we have strong negotiating power, consider the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>You have to meet stricter criteria than if you were to have a deposit or at least a larger deposit.</li>
              <li>Some lenders may charge a higher interest rate, although this isn’t true with all lenders.</li>
              <li>As an investment strategy, a no deposit home loan is really only suited to sophisticated investors. When building your investment portfolio, applying for too many no deposit home loans may affect your mortgage exposure limit with a given bank in the medium to long term.</li>
              <li>Since you’re borrowing a larger loan amount, your regular mortgage repayments will also be higher.</li>
              <li>You’re not always exempt from all bank fees and may still need some money put aside to cover application fees, lender fees, legal fees and valuation fees.</li>
            </ul>
