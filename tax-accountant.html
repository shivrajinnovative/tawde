                becomes an individual person in the eyes of law. Registering the
                proprietary limited company in Australia will cost $495. If you
                haven’t registered the company then you will be regarded as a
                sole trader. If you are setting up the company or purchasing the
                existing one you will figure out the start-up costs such as
                accounting fees, stock, furniture, staff wages, cash is required
                till you start earning from your business. Setting up a company
                required the cash so you need to plan and forecast the expenses
                that will occur initially.

                your needs depending on your personal circumstances and future
                goals. <br />
                We can assist you to register Self-Managed Super Funds,
                Company’s, Trusts, Partnerships and other entities depending on
                your needs. Each entity has different implications and
                accounting methodology that is required at the end of each year.
                Some allow for greater flexibility than others in terms of the
                distributions of funds to trustees and beneficiaries. <br />
                We can guide you into establishing smart business structures
                that will work for you. You may find that the best solution to

                your behalf to make sure you set up structures that protect
                assets and minimise tax implications.

                It is always advisable to consult a tax adviser however there
                are things to claim on tax are the interest on your investment
                loan, accountant fees, insurance on the rental property, repairs
                and maintenance, also corporate fees, land tax, depreciation on
                the building also include fixtures and fittings.
                <br />
                Note: Stamp duty is not included in a tax however it is included
                when you buy a property but it can help you to reduce any
                capital gain on tax payable if you sell the property in profit.
                You should always take advice from professionals, it is
                important as they can advise you better without breaking tax
                office rules. Maintaining proper records will lead you to
                maximize your investment in property tax investment. You should
                always separate your home expenses from rental property, also
                should hold onto the receipts so thatyou can claim expenses on
                tax.
                <br />
                Negative gearing means that you borrow money for an investment
                and the income is less than the expenses. This is a very common
                scenario for an investment property, where the rental income is
                less than the expenses, which means you are in loss. If you are
                making a loss in your investment and is costing you money then
                you should have another source of income to fund your expenses.
                Capital Gain means the amount you receive after selling your
                capital assets such as property or shares. Capital gains need to
                report in your income tax return and pay tax on capital gains,
                this is a part of income tax which referred to a capital gain
                tax, it is not a separate tax. Capital gain is added to your
                income and it will eventually increase the tax you pay, you need
                to seek advice from your tax adviser on the amount of tax you
                will pay and keep aside the funds to cover the relevant amount.
                Capital gain tax is not applicable on depreciating assets such
                as business equipment and fitting on rental property. If you
                incurred loss then you cannot claim it on other incomes but it
                will help to reduce the capital gain.

                <br />

                Foreign Income Tax Returns means that you need to pay tax on
                worldwide income if you are an Australian resident. So you have
                to declare income tax return on foreign income. Foreign income
                includes business income which means you need to pay Australian
                tax return on all the foreign business activities depends on a
                number of factories in other countries. Service income or
                employment is also included in a foreign income tax return which
                means that you need to declare tax for all the income i.e.
                salary, consultation fees or any other remuneration. If you have
                done any investments or own any assets outside Australia then
                you declare the foreign income tax return that includes,
                pensions, rental income, dividends and share, government
                pensions, income from super funds, interest on bank deposits.

                <h2 class="fs-5 fw-bold">GST & BAS Statements</h2>
                <p>
                  Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a value-added tax charged 10%
                  only on the supply of goods and services manufactured and
                  imported in Australia. If you own a business, it is important
                  to get it registered for GST, though it doesn’t apply to every
                  business. A company should register for GST, if:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is running as a profitable business.</li>
                  <li>Its annual turnover exceeds $75,000.</li>
                  <li>It meets the GST turnover threshold.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Business Activity Statement (BAS) is a quarterly or monthly
                  report submitted by a small entity or business to the
                  Australian Taxation Office (ATO). It generally contains the
                  details about the taxes a business needs to pay. This
                  statement must be submitted to the ATO before the due date to
                  avoid financial penalties. At Aussiztax, we assist businesses
                  in filing and submitting GST and BAS statements for final
                  submission. You can rely on us for secure and efficient tax
                  planning.

                <h2 class="fs-5 fw-bold">TFN and ABN Registration</h2>
                <p>
                  To file taxes and to make sure you are complying with all the
                  business regulations, it is important to register a business.
                  To ensure you are complying with all regulations it is
                  important to know which registrations apply to your business.
                  Tax File Number (TFN) and Australian Business Number (ABN) are
                  two common registration required by a small business in
                  Australia. Tax File Number (TFN) is a nine-digit number that
                  is unique for every business and issued by the Australian Tax
                  Office (ATO). In case, you have a business as a sole trader,
                  TFN is used for business and personal dealings with the ATO.
                  If you are running your business on a partnership or trust
                  basis, you’ll receive a separate TFN. Australian business
                  number (ABN) is a unique 11-digit number which is generally
                  used by the businesses to interact with the government at
                  different levels when needed. ABN is used to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Confirm your business identity when ordering or invoicing
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Avoid pay as you go (PAYG) tax on payments you receive
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Operate in the GST system, such as claiming the GST credits
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  For all sort of TFN and ABN registration needs in Dandenong,
                  Derrimut, Craigieburn, Geelong, Pakenham, and Hobart rely at
